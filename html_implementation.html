                        <p class="regular px-3">This is a story of a software implementation. Carried out with passion and devotion. With no previous experience of people involved and no plan whatsoever. Just pure spontaneity. I still can't believe we actually did it. <br><br> The description below doesn't fully reflect all the effort and stress and difficulties we were facing during the implementation progress. But on the other hand that's not the point of this story. The point is to show You the adventure. And that was quite an adventure, I tell You... I would be honored if You read some more.</p>

                       <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">We need a software!</h4>
                        <p class="regular px-3">Once upon a time there was a popular Museum in a big city, a part of a huge and renown University actually, with no integrated software to handle bookings, distribute souvenirs and tickets online, rent conference rooms, manage employees working hours, prepare sales reports... <br><br> A change needed to be done to make lifes of both employees an clients easier. Some sort of sales & booking application would be a breakthgrough, we thought, necessary to attract more visitors and to increase the work comfort of the tourist service team. But where do we start?</p> 
                    
                    </div>

                       <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">And we need people!</h4>
                        <p class="regular px-3">  No one really knew how to answer that question, me included. Yet my superiors trusted me and put me in charge of the whole project. So I coordinated it from the crazy beginnings till the relief-bringing end. 'I'm the one to praise or to blame', I thought. <br><br>It wouldn't be possible without the support of many friendly people, both co-workers and contractors, I met and worked with. We learned a lot from each other and about ourselves. First of all we found out we could more. </p>

                        <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">Our approach</h4>
                         <p class="regular px-3"> The action took place not in the modern office of a leading IT company, somewhere on the 10th floor of a shiny scyscraper. It took place in a building which dates back to Middle Ages, in a museum whose sole purpose of existence is to preserve the past and display it to the people. <br><br> There were no scheduled dailies, no backlogs, no storypoints used, no sprints, no iterations, no retros... I'm not saying all of these had been redundant. I'm just saying I'm proud we managed without even realizing such things existed. </p>

                         <p class="regular px-3">  We didn't have to do any research to recognize our needs as we knew exactly what we had been missing. We wrote our requirements down one by one and invited some companies we found online to address them. <br><br> We looked through all the responses and decided wich one best suits our expectations. What was left was to buy the required product according to all the legal regulations that apply to a state financed institution, prepare a contract, sign it and wait for the first software samples to come.</p>

                        <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">(How) does it work?</h4>
                         <p class="regular px-3"> After weeks of anxious anticipation the software finally arrived and triggered a range of emotions as the whole team needed to adapt to the brand new circumstances. The process of testing and learning started. <br><br> At first most needed modules - administration, ticket booking, personnel management - were launched and soon enough all the data migrated from testing area to production one. We started working with the software for real.</p>

                        <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">Setting up</h4>
                         <p class="regular px-3"> There was so much more to set up! For starters an internet infrastructure had to be prepared as the sales app runs online. It included hardware, cloud servers (with Linux), back-up policy, remote access control mechanism and many more. <br><br> On the software administration level employees had to be assigned to certain tasks and specific permissions were granted to them stating what they could or couldn't do. Temporary credentials were also created for every team member used to log in for the first time.  </p>

                         <p class="regular px-3"> Next step was to make online ticket sale possible. First we built a website on our own and it actually worked flawlessly for about a year. But ultimately, as the app grew bigger and bigger, it occured a professional one is a must-have. <br><br> We chose wich design studio to work with, accepted the initial project, tested the early release, proposed some minor but numerous amendments and the end-version could finally be approved. Both websites, the one we made ourselves and the latter one, are to be judged <a href="html_webdesign.html">here</a>.</p>

                         <p class="regular px-3"> Simultaneously the process of payment operator selection was running. It was quite challenging as we needed the services of both online payment operator as well as payment terminal operator (at the ticket office). And both had to be integrated with our application... <br><br> It soon become clear that communicating with one company is a piece of cake actually compared to juggling not two, not three, but four parties' interests at the same time. Luckily we all delivered. </p>

                         <p class="regular px-3"> There were more things to do, problems to face, situations to deal with. Minding the ocean-sized patience of whoever reads this, let me just briefly mention some of them. <br><br> So we bought some hardware (PC's, monitors, cash registers, UPS's etc.). Composed, consulted, translated into English and published: the 'Terms of Service', the 'Privacy Policy (GDPR)' and the 'Accesibility Statement'. And last but not least: integrated the sales app with the SAP business management software used at the University. </p>

                         <p class="regular px-3"> Employees come and go. The newcomers need access and training, the ones who remain onboard want to develop and adjust the app. The museum tourist offer keeps changing (new exhibitions, opening hours, ticket prices). The programm crashes or we don't know how to use some of its features and we need to be rescued by technical support team. <br><br> What I'm trying to say is that the job is never done, never finished. As long as we use the app, it requests to be taken care of around the clock. </p>

                         <p class="regular px-3"> The University consists of many units, the museum being merely one of them. The app has caught the attention of some other units - two of them have already joined. <br><br> The potential of the app is overwhelming. More modules can be installed (ticket machines, automated entry gates, information screens). Some of wich we have already purchased and the implementation of others is just a matter of time. </p>

                         <p class="regular px-3"> Enough with all the modesty :) I consider the implementation of the sales app as the biggest success in my professional career so far. I was deeply involved in every stage of it, I coordinated the whole project, juggled all the threads of this complex story. I'm still the leading adminstrator of the software and deal with it on daily basis.
                        <br><br> It wasn't without the consequences as the amount of stress, time sensitive moments, the number of data pieces coming in from every direction - sometimes it seemed to much. But I'll never forget what I've learned. The implementation revealed the importance of IT to me. And proved I can deliver. <br><br> <b>I'm deeply grateful I could share this experience with You.
